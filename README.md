## Overview
Regexer is a simple Go-based tool designed to search for specified keywords in the response bodies of web pages. It supports both single URL and bulk URL processing with concurrent execution.

## Features
- Scan a single URL or a list of URLs.
- Search for specific keywords in response bodies.
- Concurrent execution for improved performance.
- Output results to the console or a file.
- Customizable timeout settings.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, install it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/).

### Build the Binary
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vijay922/Regexer.git
cd Regexer

# Build the executable
go build -o regexer
mv regexer /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage
### Scan a Single URL
```sh
regexer -u https://example.com -w "apikey=,access_token=,secret=,auth=,password=,session=,jwt=,bearer=,Authorization=,Bearer,eyJ,AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
```

### Scan a List of URLs

regexer -l urls.txt -w "wp-content,wp-login,wp-admin,wp-includes,wp-json,xmlrpc.php,wordpress,wp-config,wp-cron.php" -c 10 -o results.txt
```
- `-u` : Specify a single URL.
